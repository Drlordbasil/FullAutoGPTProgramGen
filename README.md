# README for GPTMasterSlaveWithPlugins

## Overview

The `GPTMasterSlaveWithPlugins` project is a Python-based application that leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo API to create a conversational interface between a "Master AI" and a "Slave AI". The Master AI can ask questions and discuss ideas with the Slave AI, which in turn responds and executes Python code as needed. The project also includes a Plugin Manager for extending functionality and a log viewer for debugging.
